The goal of the letter is to demonstrate that net neutrality supporters are wrong to argue that Title II regulation is needed to protect ISPs from interference from ISPs.\n\nThe ISPs, all of which have expressed their belief that the FCC should kill or amend the net neutrality bill in front of the FCC, say the bill would not make it easier for them to grow, while giving the FCC too much power over the internet business.\n\nThe ISPs contend that \"this proposal would lead to higher costs and fewer options for consumers and competition,\" according to the memo, and the industry is worried about the economic consequences of repealing net neutrality.\n\nThe ISPs also assert that net neutrality has not protected consumers against ISPs discriminating against websites based on how they look at traffic on their networks. One example is that Comcast doesn't send customers to its own websites but instead sends them all to a competitor website. In one case, Comcast blocked YouTube.com because of complaints about how the platform was handling its traffic.\n\nThe ISPs also say net neutrality is bad for innovation.

Thanks for visiting!\n\nOver at The Huffington Post they do a good job presenting the evidence for the idea that climate change, while mostly a man-made problem, is also a natural-climate-causing problem.\n\nAnd they do it a little differently than most climate models. When I look at their list of global temperature data I see many data points in the early 20th century which are much higher than the current average of 15.6\u00b0C. Also, some regions had warming much later than our current warming rate of about 0.2\u00b0C per decade which is similar to the current warming rate.\n\nI am no scientist, simply a climate \"skeptic\". When it comes to climate models, I am in the camp that says that the climate models can be wrong, because they have problems getting the climate system to behave the way the models expect it to. For example, one model (NEDM \u2013 NIPCC's Climate Models and Methods Discussion Version 2) which was proposed in 1995 by the \"Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change\" (NIPCC) predicts a significant decline in net primary production (NPP) in mid-latitudes beginning now, while all other models predict a similar increase.\n\nHowever, if anything happens in the future that I don't think we can account for, it could be that some future change in the climate system will cause a natural weather anomaly (e.g. cooler ocean, colder surface air, increased rain and snowfall, etc.) to be temporarily observed, which will then be magnified by the climate model to produce the desired climate change.\n\nThe new NASA satellite data are just one example of the type of observations that are being made in the 21st century that help us understand that the climate is naturally changing. Just as importantly, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the greenhouse gas climate change caused by greenhouse gas emission is indeed causing warming.\n\nAdvertisements", "length": 416, "ended": true}

By the 1990s, hip-hop music became popular in urban areas like Chicago, NYC and Los Angeles.

There is one line in \"Backstabber\" that might not be a coincidence: \"My people's lives have been ripped apart... I've stabbed two men, two men.\" Could be an inside joke on Chicago, Chicago residents are famous for murdering people but are not called that as much in the country they live in.

As a result, it is a collection that speaks to the world of military photography.\n\nFor the project: What was the idea behind capturing all these images? And how did you decide on the locations?\n\nI am a big collector of photos and so I took to Boulcott with a passion. Some were taken by those who were there; many more were taken by others, many of whom weren't there at all.\n\nAll, of course, had to find a location and we found it because of its unique location and historic status. There is a great sense of security here. The army and air force are very thorough, and their photographers have been quite efficient.\n\nWhat do you hope this project gets across?\n\nAll the photos are here because I love those men and women who work here. They are like family to me and it was a pleasure to capture their images. I hope that this project will encourage others to make a point about the nature and scope of photography in the 21st century.\n\nI hope that the photographs capture people in their everyday moments and tell a story about them, which, as I said, is very important when thinking about the current political situation.", "length": 409, "ended": true}

This industry is very old and has been around for thousands of years. From the days of horse power and the steam engine to the advent of new technology and renewable energy, these industries are constantly striving to improve efficiency, produce more energy, and reduce the negative impacts of their use.\n\nHowever, in the past five decades, the pace and scale of electricity production has dramatically increased. According to the Department of Energy, as of 2012 about 50 percent of all electricity came from renewables while the remaining 50 percent came from fossil fuel sources. This is quite an achievement if you would ask me.\n\nFluid power storage is one form of storage that is very important for the increasing use of renewable energy. Energy storage helps to improve the amount of energy available to each region by letting a facility like a solar plant, for example, store enough energy to meet a large energy demand while also taking it back to the grid in greater quantity later.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at fluid power storage, as well as some more advanced technologies for future storage applications. We will first show you some of the different technologies as well as what kind of companies are working on these technologies. Secondly, we will discuss what challenges the industry is facing today and how manufacturers can adapt to these challenges to successfully improve the efficiency of storage and reduce the cost of storage.

I used the Raspberry Pi 3 which is a little more expensive than my old Raspberry Pi 2.\n\nThe idea was to connect up one of the nodes to a wifi access point and control it from a laptop or desktop computer using my laptop browser using the Raspberry Pi's remote console. The server would then be monitoring the wireless network to see if there were any clients connecting.\n\nI tried a few different solutions to allow the client to communicate with the Raspberry Pi's terminal from outside the home network. I tried using an SSH client or simply configuring a telnet client that forwarded all traffic. Each of these solutions worked perfectly except for the second problem which was that telnet doesn't work from a router. All attempts to configure another telnet server over a network failed as the Raspberry Pi didn't have a proper configuration.\n\nI ended up installing SSH and configured a tftp server on a router which gave me access to the Raspberry Pi itself!\n\nHere are the steps to set up an SSH server:\n\nDownload the latest version of the SSH client. Open Terminal. If the file is named \"sshrc\", then type \"sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\". If it isn't named \"sshrc\", then type \"sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\". Save the file as \"sshrc\" and save your changes. Start SSH by typing \"sudo service ssh start\" Now the client (the laptop or desktop client) will have access from outside the home network and can connect to the Raspberry Pi by typing \"ssh pi@192.168.1.1\".\n\nIn my case, I only used a laptop as the Raspberry Pi doesn't support a keyboard which can connect via a keyboard and mouse. Now I can connect my Raspberry Pi to my work client and let it manage the Raspberry Pi from the laptop.", "length": 402, "ended": true}

Republicans meet in groups of about 40 to 100 people, and in each group, people vote one for one to nominate one candidate for president; two other people vote for the other candidate or run for the position but do not get a vote themselves. The candidate who receives the most votes goes to the Republican National Convention, representing the Republican Party, and the second-place candidate goes to serve as an alternate to the Republican National Convention.\n\nDemocrats: The caucus-based process means that delegates from many of the key counties across Iowa and most of the surrounding states are chosen by the caucus delegates directly. There are some differences at the Democratic Party's state conventions from the caucuses: The candidates who receive the most votes will be automatically nominated.\n\nIndependents: Unlike delegates to the Republican National Convention, the results at the state and local conventions are not used to determine a candidate for president. Instead, those states hold caucuses in which the delegates are selected at public meetings.\n\nCaucus delegates can play different roles at the caucuses: They may attend the meeting to cast their ballots in line with the candidate they support, volunteer their opinions, or do both.\n\nWhen does the voting take place?

Twenty-seven of the studies utilized vitamin D3 alone, 13 were in adults without clinical asthma, and three were in adults with clinical asthma. Supplementation with vitamin D3 and vitamin D3-binding protein or D3 or its analogues was associated with significant reduction in markers of inflammation. A positive dose-response relationship was found for the inflammatory markers: CRP (0.07-0.27 mmol.L(-1) vs. 8.2-18.6 mmol.L(1)*pmol(-1), p = 0.03), IL-6 (1.10-10.3 ng/mL vs. 3.4-15.2 ng/mL, p = 0.007), IL-8 (0.17-4.21 and 4.18-16.6 vs. 2.42-8.11 ng/mL, p = 0.005), and tNF-alpha (0.15-0.36 ng/mL vs. 3.35-9.03 ng/mL, p = 0.05).

The official source for the name is a 2009 video from the band, where Chadwick Stoneman states \"A bunch of guys from different states came over and did a song we actually had recorded.

On the heels of the terrorist attacks in Paris, it's become increasingly evident that we have less time to connect with loved ones. In fact, we have less time than we thought we did.\n\nA new study by the Pew Research Center, conducted over the phone between November 18 and 20, found that, on average, people in the US spend 2 hours a day on the phone with loved ones. That average includes three hours with friends, two hours with family, and two hours with colleagues.\n\nAnd that's only counting the time people spend talking on the phone. That brings the average time spent conversing on the phone in one day down to two hours and 15 minutes.\n\nThere's a few reasons for the slowdown. For one, there's the whole thing about work. As of 2015, 44 percent of US workers reported that they spent more than three hours a day on the phone with co-workers. And that translates to 2,500 minutes of office time.\n\nSecond, some people might be cutting back on their phone usage after a long year or two of being a busy bee.\n\nThird, a lot of people may also be using their spare time to socialize. It's hard to avoid checking in with family, checking in on Facebook friends and seeing what the fuss is up with what's happening in the world.

All of them had been in the community for at least a decade, had lived in rural areas for at least 10 years, had lived in the same region for at least 10 years, and had a general health condition known or undiagnosed at the time of the study. The women who took part were tested for a wide variety of mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, and depression as well as substance use disorders, using a common questionnaire to rate illness severity.\n\nThe researchers concluded that some women who had poor self-reported mental health and/or had been diagnosed with depression experienced more severe mental illness than the others in the group.\n\nThe researchers speculate that high levels of depression make it harder for women to maintain long-term relationships.

The new version includes an update to Quantum Mode.\n\n\nFirefox Quantum mode is a completely new version of Firefox that is designed to be fast, smooth, and perform better. It's based around the multi-process Firefox Quantum framework that was demonstrated earlier this year at Web Summit.\n\nFirefox Quantum also makes use of JavaScript code that's optimized for the new engine, and the browser is able to run code directly on the CPU as opposed to the GPU. This in turn helps the browser run faster, smoother, and with a more responsive user-interface.\n\nWe are seeing users reporting that Firefox Quantum is running smoother, especially on the desktop. The browser also runs more smoothly for people who are using AMD graphics card.\n\nHere are some of the improvements that users have reported so far:\n\nFirefox Quantum runs faster than Nightly build 24.0.\n\nUsers don't notice any visual or performance changes.\n\nThe download size is about 15 % smaller than the Nightly build.\n\nHere's a screenshot we took of the desktop Firefox version from Firefox Quantum. The Firefox Quantum desktop appears to be running faster on the desktop as compared to Nightly 24.0.\n\nHere's another screenshot of the Firefox Quantum desktop running in DX11 mode on an MSI A320 GTX 970 Gaming video card. This GPU runs the game Battlefield 1 better than the Nightly build of Firefox, as we could see from the Battlefield 1 FPS numbers.\n\nIn addition to the performance gains in this build, Mozilla also introduced a new menu page that's similar to the Nightly version. Users can access the Nightly menu by turning off Nightly in the menu options that are located in the main menu bar on the upper-right hand side. However, this menu page doesn't have any of the new performance enhancements that Mozilla has bundled in Quantum.", "length": 403, "ended": true}

This seems unlikely if our brains are adapted to hearing the natural noise levels of the environment. A study from a small town may suggest how sound may change, the University of Cambridge reports. Research has suggested that natural sounds are not as loud as what we might expect during the city, and that sounds that are a mix of both natural and urban noises are louder still. So what are the noises that make us really hear well?\n\nTo determine the natural noises that sound like things when you hear them, researchers from the University of Cambridge placed a microphone in a room where a bunch of high-fives and grumble mumbles were gathered between groups of volunteers. The researchers picked out sounds they thought were the real deal, and then asked the subjects to rate them. The researchers found that the sounds that come out of natural objects and sounds like thunder and thunderstorms made people very comfortable in the experiment. They got a little grumble of their own when they heard the sounds.\n\nWhen the sounds were mixed in with the sounds from urban environments, people were made feel less at home in the study, the research indicates. It's not so much about hearing better or even that the sounds are actually of good quality, but rather that they feel more of a home in the unnatural environment.

Each web browser is configured for a different way of displaying a web page. For example, you can put tabs in the toolbar in Firefox, but not in a separate tab in Internet Explorer.\n\nThere's another way, however. You could use JavaScript to create a different style to make the UI more intuitive to the user.\n\nHTML classes are an easy way to create a different presentation for the content of a page, depending on the browser's configuration. For instance, you can create elements like button and img that will be displayed different in the tabbed layout. This is an example of class based UI.\n\nNote that when you make styling styles, you need to assign values as well. When you use a different CSS property than the one that was assigned to an HTML element, HTML will convert it to a CSS style instead. So there might be conflicts when making styles depending on whether you use HTML or CSS property.\n\nBelow is an example tabbed layout CSS, that will work with Chrome (or Safari, etc), but not with Firefox. To change the layout of a tabbed list to your preferences, change the style CSS property, from \"tab-separator\" to \"tab\" as below:\n\nTabbed layout CSS\n\n.list { background: url(img/tab.png) no-repeat 0 0; } .list:hover { background: url(img/tab1.png); } .list:active { background: url(img/tab2.png); // this style is supported in Firefox tab { background: url(img/tab3.png); } }\n\nFor more examples of CSS styles to implement different layouts, see CSS layout properties.\n\nLearn how to find support for other browsers.", "length": 394, "ended": true}

Lice that live on small animals such as rodents or on the scalp often can't be taken out with the use of insecticides, and, therefore, they must be removed from other locations on the body, such as the head, legs, and nails in order to become susceptible to treatment.\n\nLice on horses are an even bigger problem than those on larks.

My first thought was, \"How many copies of each color would people want to play in their Cube?\" Fortunately, it turns out everyone else thought so, too.\n\nAfter playtesting, I've decided to use the first two drafts of the format as the baseline. When it comes time to update the set accordingly, I'll have a slightly different set of numbers. For more on this upcoming product, read on\u2026.\n\nIt's a New Deck\n\nIn order to get started, players will create a unique Magic Online account with a cube that features one of sixteen unique Magic Origins cards and 16 new cards that haven't been printed in Magic Online before. As usual, players can create their Cube through the in-client version or through the Draft Service. If you play with other players in the Cube, it helps to build relationships with them because they will play the deck from your Cube for a week when you send them into their Cube.\n\nIf a player's Cube includes two or more different cards, we won't be able to allow for the card to be included.

Since then, however, many Roma and other non-EU migrants have been trying to enter Hungary from Greece.\n\nThe government has introduced a series of changes since then to prevent migrants from crossing the razor-wire fence that it built at the border in September 2015, saying they violate European Union law and could lead to civil unrest.\n\nHowever, thousands of migrants continue to arrive, making it tough for the government to justify the tough measures being imposed and putting pressure on Europe to agree a solution.\n\nIn July, authorities detained and relocated more than 2,000 migrants, many of whom were from Sudan and Afghanistan and were arriving from Hungary's westernmost border with Serbia.\n\nAt the start of September, Hungary reintroduced border controls and relocated its nationals from Turkey and other European countries, including Germany and Austria, who were among the first European countries to halt migrants reaching the EU with the help of the Turkish border agreement.", "length": 379, "ended": true}

They refused to pay, arguing that Mr. Pugh has his choice to choose where he visits.\n\nHis response? Mr. Pugh offered to pay $20 per visit, as long as the museum was happy to let him buy those tickets at any price. After the museum's general counsel agreed to this deal, Mr. Pugh's \"Experiment\" was launched in June 2011.\n\nBut the museum system was not pleased. As NPR reports, CMA's lawyer told Mr. Pugh and his lawyers in a letter that the museum system \"stands fully by its long-standing policy of not purchasing tickets for people who pay other people to give the tickets to them.\"\n\nSo Mr. Pugh, knowing that he had the money to continue his experiment but also that the CMA would likely oppose his request, took a different tack. He wrote a press release and sent it to The Chicago Tribune, USA Today and the New York Times. This time, the CMA was willing to go along with Mr. Pugh. The press release gave the press release in full, but in the lead, Mr. Pugh wrote \"For an additional gratuity of $1000, The Chicago History Museum will allow one guest, not its staff, to have an item offered to him on his first visit on the CMA's website: a Chicago History Museum guide to African American history.\"", "length": 419, "ended": true}

In contrast, the British did their job, bringing down many rulers that allowed Muslims to rule in India, and in the aftermath a \"clear narrative of Muslim-Muslim conflict\" emerged, making the issue taboo.\n\nThe report pointed out that the only thing that has been done in Punjab in the past two decades in the name of religious tolerance is the building of a mosque in Amritsar and construction of a mosque at Guru Nanak Temple in Amritsar.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "length": 412, "ended": true}
