DEPENDABLE AI MINOR 1


## About
Machine learning based language models have recently made significant progress, which introduces a danger to spread misinformation.
To combat this potential danger, several methods have been proposed for detecting text written by these
language models. One of the popular one is roBERTa neural text detector by OPENAI.Following implementation does black-box attacks on these
detectors, by  randomly replaces characters with homoglyphs.



## Steps to run the file

1. Extarct the zip folder to get .ipynb file.
2. Get the API token from hugging- face of model roberta-base-openai-detector and paste in the api function.(can skip this step as i have given the api token).
3. Upload the processed_data.jsonl in the google collab.
4. Restart and run all the cells of B20AI039_MINOR1.ipynb.
